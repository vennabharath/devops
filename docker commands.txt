docker create 	creates a container but does not start it.
docker rename 	allows the container to be renamed.
docker run 	creates and starts a container in one operation.
docker rm	 deletes a container.
docker update 	updates a container's resource limits.

If you want to map a directory on the host to a docker container, 

docker run -v $HOSTDIR:$DOCKERDIR

If you want to remove also the volumes associated with the container, 
the deletion of the container must include the -v switch like in 

docker rm -v

There's also a logging driver available for individual containers in docker 1.10. 
To run docker with a custom log driver (i.e., to syslog), use docker run --log-driver=syslog

docker run --name yourname docker_image 
because when you specify the --name inside the run command this will
allow you to start and stop a container by calling it with the name the you 
specified when you created it.

Starting and Stopping
docker start 	starts a container so it is running.
docker stop 	stops a running container.
docker restart 	stops and starts a container.
docker pause 	pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
docker unpause 	will unpause a running container.
docker wait 	blocks until running container stops.
docker kill	 sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
